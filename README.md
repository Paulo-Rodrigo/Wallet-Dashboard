# Wallet Dashboard ðŸ“Š

This is a project made with ReactJS and TypeScript, using [Recharts](https://recharts.org/en-US) library and [React Count-up](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-countup), based on this [course](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-e-typescript/), to practice front-end concepts and React concepts.

## Link to the project: [Wallet Dashboard](https://wallet-dashboard.vercel.app)

It's a simple personal dashboard, to monitore finances in a visual way. There are 3 main pages in the app, and the first one you will see is the Sign-up page.
I didn't use database, so the values of the application are in most static. To access the dashboard, you will need to sign-in with this values:

### email: `user@email.com`
### password: `password`

After that, you will be able to navigate in the application, starting with the dashboard screen. The app allows you to change themes, select the months and year to calculate the balance and see your gains and expenses (in the list page).

The last part are the list pages, that allows to the user select the respective expenses or gains, based in if they're recurrent or eventual. There are two similar screens, "Entradas" and "SaÃ­das", which can be accessed in the aside menu.
